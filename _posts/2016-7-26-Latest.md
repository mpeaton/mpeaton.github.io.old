Messing around with [JUCE](https://www.juce.com/), as I'm working on a utility for audio processing.  Why are my eyes glazing over?  This post will walk through the details of that project as it progresses, and as I get time to document.  Until then, I'm staring at the API, and flipping between examples.... zzz guess I need [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).

```cpp

#include "inheritance diagrams.h"

```
