I was wondering if after all these years you like to meet.

Ok so instead of working, I started this blog.  I was inspired by [Colah's blog](http://colah.github.io/), but then thought I'd better start with something a little more simple.  So I found [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and elected to give it a go.  Barry's article in [smashing magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) is helpful. 

 I've attempted a few blogs before now, including a wordpress site.  Using static pages with jekyll and [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). This is the easiest by far! 

Cool.  Now for some content...
