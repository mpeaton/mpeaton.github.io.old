title: Check one, check two.... is this thing on?

In order to experiment with the basics of Tensorflow, I installed it and Jupyter on a [ Digital Ocean box I am not using much ](http://104.236.233.240:8888/notebooks/1_hello_tensorflow.ipynb).  Useful for experimenting with syntax, but only very small scale without GPU or much memory. My aspiration is to experiment with, and perhaps contribute to [project Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/welcome-to-magenta).  Looks like I'm going to have to invest in some hardware.  Is anyone out there interested in sponsoring some attemt at digital art?
