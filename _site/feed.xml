&lt;p&gt;Ok so instead of working, I started this blog.  I was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://colah.github.io/&quot;&gt;Colah’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, but then thought I’d better start with something a little more simple.  So I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now&quot;&gt;Jekyll Now&lt;/a&gt; and elected to give it a go.  Barry’s article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/&quot;&gt;smashing magazine&lt;/a&gt; is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve attempted a few blogs before now, including a wordpress site.  Using static pages with jekyll and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;. This is the easiest by far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool.  Now for some content…&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>I was wondering if after all these years you like to meet.</summary></entry></feed>
